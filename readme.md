# Concurrent Programming

In this project, you are going to be calculating the average of three lists using four different approaches:

* Sequential approach
* Async approach
* Threading approach
* Multiprocessing approach

Your goal will be to make this calculation as efficient as possible and see which approaches work well 
and which ones struggle.
